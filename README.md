# VibeHive-Music

I developed VibeHive-Music as a Windows-based application using C#. The app is focused on music album management, allowing users to organize and interact with music data through an intuitive graphical user interface. My project is structured as a multi-project .NET solution, with components dedicated to different aspects of music library and rental management.

Key Features:

I designed and built a Windows Forms GUI for seamless album management (see files like Form1.cs and Form1.Designer.cs).
I modularized the solution using multiple project files (AlbumForm, AlbumGUI, MusicRentalManagementGUI) to keep the code organized and scalable.
I implemented integration points for APIs and external data sources (demonstrated in AlbumApi.cs).
I managed application and user-specific settings using config files (App.config, packages.config).
Technologies & Skills:

Language: C#
Framework: .NET Framework, Windows Forms
Skills:
Full-stack desktop application development
Object-oriented programming
GUI and event-driven design
API integration
Dependency and project management (via NuGet and .csproj files)
Solution modularization
My Role: I handled the entire development cycle—from designing the user interface and backend logic to managing dependencies and application configuration. I structured the application for maintainability and ease of extension, and I ensured a smooth user experience in Windows environments.

Impact: This project demonstrates my ability to build robust desktop applications, structure codebases for scalability, and integrate multiple system components. It’s a strong example of my technical skills and my commitment to delivering well-organized, user-friendly software.
